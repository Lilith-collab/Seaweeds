# Seaweeds

In the past, large amounts of seaweeds regularly washed up around Saldanha Bay/Langebaan. These were collected for the extraction of agar, which has many uses in the food industry. However, over the last few decades, wash-ups have declined drastically, likely due to urban expansion in the bay. The unpredictability of wash-ups resulted in the industry becoming unstable and less profitable. Three of the main agar-producing seaweeds in South Africa are the kelps *Ecklonia maxima* and *Laminaria pallida*, and the red alga *Gelidium pristoides*. This repository is for mapping the distribution of agar-producing seaweed species in relation to existing Marine Protected Areas. This information will be used to determine whether the seaweeds occur in current MPAs, or whether new MPAs should be created or existing ones expanded. 
The species occurrence data comes from iNaturalist and the SA Marine Protected Area Zonations data can be accessed via the Department of Forestry, Fisheries and the Environment [here](https://egis.environment.gov.za/data_egis/data_download/current).
